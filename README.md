Welcome to my **React** project, created as part of the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) bootcamp. This project continues on and uses the [Back-end API project](https://github.com/MartinSWDev/NC-Backend-Project) to allow users to interact with different games reviews.
**This is being developed as mobile first and currently the css is only working in mobile view.**
